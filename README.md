PASSWORD:

Certainly! The provided Python code is a simple password generator GUI built using the tkinter library. Let's break down the code into sections:

Imports:

python
Copy code
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import messagebox
import random
import string
Import necessary modules:
tkinter: GUI library.
messagebox: For displaying error messages.
random: For generating random values.
string: For working with string constants and functions.
Password Generation Function:

python
Copy code
def generate_password():
    length = int(length_entry.get())
    if length < 4:
        messagebox.showerror("Error", "Password length should be at least 4 characters")
        return

    strength = strength_var.get()

    if strength == "Weak":
        characters = string.ascii_lowercase
    elif strength == "Medium":
        characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
    else:  # Strong
        characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation

    password = ''.join(random.choice(characters) for i in range(length))
    password_entry.delete(0, tk.END)
    password_entry.insert(tk.END, password)
This function is triggered when the "Generate Password" button is pressed.
It retrieves the desired password length and strength.
Based on the strength selected, it defines a set of characters (characters) to use for the password.
It generates a random password of the specified length using the chosen character set.
The generated password is then displayed in the GUI entry widget (password_entry).
GUI Initialization:

python
Copy code
root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Password Generator")
Create the main window with the title "Password Generator."
Labels and Entry Widgets for Password Length and Strength:

python
Copy code
label_length = tk.Label(root, text="Enter Password Length:")
label_length.pack()

length_entry = tk.Entry(root)
length_entry.pack()

label_strength = tk.Label(root, text="Select Password Strength:")
label_strength.pack()
Labels and entry widgets for inputting the password length and selecting the password strength.
Radio Buttons for Password Strength:

python
Copy code
strength_var = tk.StringVar()
strength_var.set("Weak")

weak_radio = tk.Radiobutton(root, text="Weak", variable=strength_var, value="Weak" )  
weak_radio.pack()

medium_radio = tk.Radiobutton(root, text="Medium", variable=strength_var, value="Medium")  
medium_radio.pack()

strong_radio = tk.Radiobutton(root, text="Strong", variable=strength_var, value="Strong")  
strong_radio.pack()
Radio buttons for selecting the password strength: "Weak," "Medium," or "Strong."
Generate Password Button:

python
Copy code
generate_button = tk.Button(root, text="Generate Password", command=generate_password)
generate_button.pack()
Button that, when clicked, triggers the generate_password function.
Entry Widget for Displaying the Generated Password:

python
Copy code
password_entry = tk.Entry(root, show="")
password_entry.pack()
Entry widget for displaying the generated password. The show="" argument ensures that the characters are not visible.
Run the GUI:

python
Copy code
root.mainloop()
Start the main event loop to run the GUI. This loop waits for user interactions and updates the GUI accordingly.















CONTACT BOOK :


Certainly! The provided Python code creates a simple contact book graphical user interface (GUI) using the `tkinter` library. This GUI allows users to add, delete, and edit contacts. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **Function Definitions:**
    - **`add_contact()`**: Adds a new contact to the contact list.
        - Retrieves the name and number from the entry widgets.
        - Checks if both the name and number are provided.
        - Inserts a new contact entry into the Listbox and clears the entry widgets.

    - **`delete_contact()`**: Deletes a selected contact from the contact list.
        - Retrieves the selected contact from the Listbox.
        - Deletes the selected contact from the Listbox.

    - **`edit_contact()`**: Opens a new window for editing a selected contact.
        - Retrieves the selected contact from the Listbox.
        - Creates a new window (`edit_window`) for editing the contact with entry widgets displaying the current contact details.
        - Allows the user to edit the name and number.
        - Provides a "Save" button to save the changes, updating the Listbox.

2. **GUI Initialization:**
    - Creates the main window for the contact book with a title, size, and background color.

3. **StringVars and Entry Widgets for Name and Number:**
    - Creates `StringVar` variables to store the name and number entered by the user.
    - Creates labels and entry widgets for entering the name and number.

4. **Buttons for Adding, Deleting, and Editing Contacts:**
    - Creates buttons for adding, deleting, and editing contacts.
    - Each button is associated with a specific function (`add_contact`, `delete_contact`, `edit_contact`).
    - Buttons have distinct colors for easy identification (blue for adding, red for deleting, and orange for editing).

5. **Listbox for Displaying Contacts:**
    - Creates a Listbox widget for displaying the list of contacts.
    - Contacts are displayed in the format "Name: Number."

6. **Main Event Loop:**
    - Starts the main event loop using `root.mainloop()`.
    - This loop keeps the GUI running, waiting for user interactions and responding accordingly.

In summary, the code provides a simple contact book interface where users can interactively add, delete, and edit contacts. The GUI elements include entry widgets, buttons, and a Listbox for displaying the contacts. The use of a separate window for editing contacts enhances the user experience.




















CALCULATOR:



This Python code creates a simple calculator GUI using the tkinter library. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations and provides a graphical user interface for users to input expressions and obtain results. Here's a detailed breakdown of the code:

Function Definitions:

button_click(value): Appends the clicked button's value to the current entry in the display.
clear_display(): Clears the entire display.
calculate(): Attempts to evaluate the expression in the display using eval and displays the result. If an error occurs during evaluation, it displays "Error."
Create the Main Window:

tk.Tk() creates the main window for the calculator with the title "Simple Calculator."
Entry Widget for Display:

Creates an entry widget to display the input and output. This widget spans multiple columns and has a specified width and border.
Define Buttons:

Buttons are organized in a 4x4 grid, where each button corresponds to a digit, arithmetic operator, or a special function.
The button layout is defined in the buttons list.
Loop to Create Buttons:

Nested loops are used to iterate over the buttons list and create buttons for each digit and operator.
For each button, a tk.Button is created with a specific text label, size (padx and pady), and associated command.
Special handling is provided for the 'C' (clear) and '=' (calculate) buttons, which have unique functions.
Grid Placement of Buttons:

Buttons are placed in the grid using the grid method, specifying the row and column positions. Padding is added for visual spacing.
Run the Application:

root.mainloop() starts the main event loop, allowing the application to respond to user interactions and updating the display accordingly.
In summary, this code creates a basic calculator application with a clear and user-friendly GUI. Users can input arithmetic expressions using the provided buttons, and the calculator will display the result or an error message if the expression is invalid.
